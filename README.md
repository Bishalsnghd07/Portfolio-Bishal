## Welcome👋

**Thanks** for checking out my web app.

## The challenge

In this challenge I built **portfolio** web app to showcase my skills and experience what I did till now.


Users should be able to:
- View the **optimal layout** for the section depending on their device's screen size
- Implemented next **"Link component"** for **client side internal navigation** without full-page load
- Incorporated **focus-visible** states for all interactive elements on the page❤️
- Applied **slow entrance animation** when page loaded🔥 and added **underline effect** with Indian color gradient in **Navbar header** looks beautiful.
- Added **transition** effect and **hover**🔥 on project slider component with new look, make sure to view it.

In addition, I ***implement background video player with z-index property, swiper slider library, ts-particles library***.
